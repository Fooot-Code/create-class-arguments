# create-class-arguments README
## Features

Just makes the self.self = self from arguments, i.e takes "x, y, width, height" and returns "self.x = x, self.y = y, self.width = width, self.height = height".
Copies the returned values with newlines in between each argument. Meant to be used for python class arguments.
